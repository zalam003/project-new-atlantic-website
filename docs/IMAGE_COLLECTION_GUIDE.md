# Image Collection Guide for New Atlantic Website

## Current Limitation
The automated image extraction is limited because:
- Web fetch tools only return text content, not full HTML with image references
- Direct access to image directories requires specific URLs from search results
- Manual collection or specialized tools are needed for comprehensive image gathering

## Image Directory Structure Created

```
public/images/
├── products/           # Product photos, garment samples
├── logos/             # Company logos, brand assets
├── hero/              # Hero section background images
├── process/           # Manufacturing process photos
├── team/              # Team photos, facility images
└── [additional categories as needed]
```
